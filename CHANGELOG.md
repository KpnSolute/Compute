# CHANGELOG

## [1.0.3] - 2026-06-02
### Design Changes
- **Project Re-Architecture:** Transitioned from Flask/Alpine.js to a modern Vite + React + FastAPI four-pillar structure.
- **Agent Identity Overhaul:** Renamed the change-logging agent to **Catch21** and the Git operations agent to **Github**.
- **Mandatory Assets:** Established `/templates` as the source of truth for all UI design changes.

### System Updates
- **Automated Logging:** Integrated **Catch21** to record all structural and design updates in real-time.
- **Git Modernization:** Established **Github** to manage repository state using Gemini CLI and project memory.
- **Instruction Alignment:** Synchronized `GEMINI.md` and `CLAUDE.md` to mandate per-prompt check-ins and session close-outs.

### Daily Summary (Close Out)
- **Current State:** The MJCC project has been completely restructured and modernized. The repository now features clean pillars for `/frontend`, `/backend`, `/data`, and `/templates`. All AI agents are aligned with this new architecture, and automated logging/pushing mechanisms are now active. The system is ready for React-based UI development and FastAPI-based service implementation.
